## Installation and Setup Instructions

Clone down this repository. You will need `node` and `npm` installed globally on your machine.  
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.


## Reflection

  - This is a side project I developed as part of learning ReactJs.
  - I wanted to build a Frontend Application using ReactJs so I thought why not to re-live my childhood fantasy of owning a Pokedex and still learn React.
  - I learned how to create a responsive single page web application using React and also learned how to use external APIs to fetch relevant data.
  - Understanding the data provided by the API was difficult at first, but this Project also taught me how to dive deep into documentations to know more about anything.
  - This application was bootstrapped using `create-react-app` to minimize the initial setup and invest more time into the main logic of the app. I also added `react-router-dom` for routing. The Styling is done using Bootstrap which is a famous and easy to use CSS Framework for creating responsive styling for the application.
